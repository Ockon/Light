## Known bugs

**Text color reverting after an Error**

We know, unfortunately for now, you will just have to go back and type your preferred color back in

**Glitched after no exit**

If you instead just exit the program and restart its relatively similar, but you will lose all your previouse syntax on some CMDs. We are working to fix this bug but it is pervasive. If you have found a way to fix this please tweet [@OckonCode](https://twitter.com/OckonCode)
