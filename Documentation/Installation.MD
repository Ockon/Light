## Installation information

To install the Light IDE:

1. Download from GitHub
2. Enter your preferred terminal and write ```python3 -pip install colorama```
3. Run the file with python

## Troubleshooting

**colorama not installing**

You may want to try ```pip install colorama``` instead of the longer version. If the problem persists, visit colorama [here](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/).

**Python not running the program**

Often, this is caused by Python not being updated to the latest version. Light uses the most cutting edge features that Python has to offer, so you may want to try installing the latest verison if you have not already.

It is also possible that the download from github has been written in the "Python Script" format, which Python may refuse to run. If that is the case, try downloading again from GitHub, but with a different file location and/or with a different file extension.
