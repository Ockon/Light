## VERSION: ALPHA 2.0


**RELEASE DATE:**  SEPTEMBER 10, 2022


## Whats new with Alpha 2.0?


Alpha 2.0 brings lots of support for developers to edit pre-existing code projects. With vast improvements to code editing in pre-existing files, rest assured that you can edit any file with Light.

Also new is the addition of fully customizable file types. You can now open, edit, and rename any file, no matter the file extension.

With Alpha 2.0 you can now change the color of your development system's text.

For developers who work on the cutting edge, we have restructured our error messages for more information, so you can find and fix problems quicker.

On opening a file, you are now able to see the contents of that file, aswell as the location of where your code will be inputed.

Loading times have been cut significantly, so you can spend more time programming and less time waiting.


## Fixes to the GitHub


The Documentation was blank, but now contains pertinent information on setup, erorrs, and general help.

All old files have been moved to their dedicated folders.

The README has been reformated to look better and have less bulky text.
