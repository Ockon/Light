# Light
### A revolutionary way to code
 
    
    
**What is this place?**
    
    
Welcome to the Light IDE. Light is designed to be a light weight, terminal-based IDE that grants a CMD the powers of a large scale, text-based development enviornment. It is simple and easy to use, and is updated regularly to add new and amazing features
    
    
**What can it do?**
    
    
Light is designed to be versatile enough to be able to handle almost anything you can throw at it. It can program in any language, any time. It can open files you didnt even know were there, and edit like you have never seen before.
        
        
**How do I install it?**
        
        
As of Alpha 2.0, simply download it from GitHub and follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/Ockon/Light/blob/main/Documentation/Installation.MD).
    
        
**What if I need help?**
    
        
Light is a brand new and revolutionary language, so finding fixes to bugs can be hard. That's why we created the Documentation page. Simply visit the [documentation page](https://github.com/Ockon/Light/blob/main/Documentation/Documentation.MD) and any question you have about programming with Light will be answered.
    
        
**How can I help the developers?** 
        
We constantly update this IDE and our website for developers to use for free. Because of this, however, we do not make any money from our work. If you would like to support us and our future endeavors please spread the word about the IDE, as the more traffic that comes through, the better chances we have of getting recognition for our work.


## CURRENT BUILD
ALPHA 2.0

Alpha 2.0 is the largest change to the new Light yet. A complete rework of the Error system allows for faster and more accurate runtime errors. Customize to your liking with an overhall of the text color system. Read and write quicker with 90% faster load times over old versions. Write in complete control with the power of truncate, a new feature that enables you to chose exactly what the file contains.

## LAST BUILD
ALPHA 1.0

Yay made it past the 0.x phase! Alpha 1.0 is a complete redesign of the IDE from the ground up. Gone are the days of using a useless keywords system and errors that dont represent much, aswell as useless math functions. Now, the entire enviornment is dedicated completely to the creation and editing of files. You can create and name any file with whatever name you chose, and dictate the contents yourself. You can also open previousely created python files and add to them.
