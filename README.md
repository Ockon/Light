# Light
A revolutionary way to code
 
    
    
**What is this place?**
    
    
Welcome to the Light programming language. Light is designed to be a light weight, terminal-based programming language that grants a CMD the powers of an IDE. It is simple and easy to use, and is updated regularly to add new and amazing features
    
    
**What can it do?**
    
    
Light is designed to be versatile enough to be able to handle almost anything you can throw at it. Currently, it is best at complex mathmatical calculations, and simple variables and tasks. Our plan is to constantly add better support for programs that are able to produce text and visuals.
        
        
**How do I install it?**
        
        
Simply download Light here on GitHub or on NPM. Then open your prefered CMD and run the program. It should run easily, right out of the box. 
    
        
**What if I need help?**
    
        
At Ockon, we know it can be hard to learn a new language, and to fix bugs in one that has a small community. That's why we have a dedicated webpage for documentation and help. Just visit Ockon.com/Documentation and everything you need will be at your fingertips.
    
        
**How can I help the developers?**
    
        
We constantly update this language and our website for you to use for free. Because of this, however, we do not make any money from our work. If you would like to support us and our future endeavors, visit Ockon.com/Support. The money will go directly to supporting us and will help us make this language even better.
